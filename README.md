You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Once that's done, you can run the following commands...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableStudio.git

cd StableStudio

yarn

yarn dev
```

_**That's Simp! ðŸŽ‰**_

SimpStudio will be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

You'll need to have your [API key](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication) handy to use the default [Stability API](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started) plugin.

If you don't have one, you can create an account on [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai) and get a key from the [account page](https://dreamstudio.ai/account).
